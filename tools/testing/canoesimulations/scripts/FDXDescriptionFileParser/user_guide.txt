How to use FDXDescriptionFileParser.py

FDXDescriptionFileParser.py --file_or_directory FOLDER_OR_FILE [--start_group_id  ID] [--skip_read_sysvar]

Generates description file from files with file ending .vsysvar and .siglist2.

System variables that is described in a .vsysvar file is normally used for signals that is simulated by CANoe and good for writing to signals. Make sure that each .vsysvar file has a 
corresponding .csv file with read (r), write (w) or force read (fr) specification for namespaces.

Signals that are described in a .siglist2 file is normally used to read value from a signal that is sent from a physical ECU. This makes it good to verify a signal value from a XIL application. 
Note: Please filter the siglist2 file to only contain signals that are transmitted (TX) from physical ECUs.

To generate description file for multiple files in a folder
1. Use CLI to start the process, ex: FDXDescriptionFileParser.py --file_or_directory test_files/fdx_files
