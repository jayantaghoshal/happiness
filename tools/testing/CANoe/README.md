# CANoe simulations for CI lab

Used together with FDX-client (vendor/volvocars/tools/testing/fdx_client)

These simulations are based on the simulations created by Infotainment test department.
They can be found in InfotainmentAoV subversion. 

The simulations have been stripped down from the original to contain the bare minimum
required to keep the IHU alive and to be able to send/receive signals from other ECUs
over the FDX protocol.

More information on this process can be found in https://c1.confluence.cm.volvocars.biz/display/IHUA/Installation+of+Vector+hardware
