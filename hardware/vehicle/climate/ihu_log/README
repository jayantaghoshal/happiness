                 IHU log
            =================

This module provides the same API as ivilogging:
    https://github.com/Pelagicore/ivi-logging.

The log data is sent to 'Android logs' as ALOGx with LOG_TAG="IHU".

The purpose is to let iCUP components keep their logging syntax and the
used api (ivi-logging.h) at initial porting. Android.mk must include
libihulog.
