Generates code used by the Dataelement framework. You only need to run this if you have received new ECU extract files from VCC or if you have changed the way the code is generated. The command is given like:

python getDatatypes.py -s <swc.arxml> -c <com.arxml> -g <output directory>

To easilly generate file for the currently used ECU extract simply run:
./rungenerate.sh
