This file shall be kept up-to-date with the latest generated by the Vector tool chain from the VIP project.

Once you put a new file here make sure you run the unit test from the top level ihu_signals directory to make sure the new files compile correctly:

./build_and_run_ut.sh

!!!! to be able to run build_and_run_ut.sh you must first have the unit test SDK installed and setup the unit test environment correctly. See for example ihu_vehiclefunctions/scripts/setup_ut_env.sh to setup the ut environment.
